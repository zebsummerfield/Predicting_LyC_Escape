We present the code attached to the Cambridge Physics Master's Project: Predicting Ionising Photon Escape During the Epoch of Reionisation. 

Understanding the sources and evolution of cosmic reionisation remains a central challenge in modern astrophysics. Developing
reliable methods to infer key galaxy properties during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) is critical for addressing these questions.
In this work we use a catalogue of more than 110,000 simulated galaxies from the thesan-zoom suite of cosmological radiation-
hydrodynamic simulations to identify indirect diagnostics of Lyman continuum (LyC) photon escape fraction and LyC
emission rate during the EoR. We then train Random Forest regression models on this catalogue, using the identified
diagnostics as input features, to predict both these EoR properties.
